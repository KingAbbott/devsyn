You must have Panda3d (http://panda3d.org) already installed on your
system in a way that python can find it.

There are windows installers and *nix platform packages from the panda3d
site itself.  It is possible to use panda3d on a OSX by compiling from source.
For OSX http://www.edalytical.com/articles/building_panda3d_on_mac_os_x_leopard.html
may be of interest.




Running:

> cd src/
> python main.py     # by default runs the game under rpg/


In rpg game:

wasd -> move camera
mouse look -> look around with camera
